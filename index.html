            <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
            <p>Persuing a career in web development has always been in my head.
              It originally started as a desire to create videogames, but as an adult
              I knew I would need a fall back incase that never came to light.</p>
            <p>So while both improving my skills at writing code I decided to begin
               working on web design. Thats when I began to look at teaching apps on
               my phone. I have tried a few but the one that helped the most by far
              was Mimo. I use it daily and since I started my skills have increased
               greatly. to the point that this blog exists!</p>
